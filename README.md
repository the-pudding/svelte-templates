# Svelte Templates

This is a collection of svelte components for you to use and modify for your projects.

[See the components](https://pudding-svelte-templates.netlify.app/)

All of the templates live in the `/templates` folder.

## Adding a template

As you create new basic components for svelte projects, add them to the `/templates` folder!

If you want to add them to the site, first run the site:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

...then add them to `/src/components/Templates.svelte`, using a `<Template>` component.

The website will automatically build & update (on Netlify) when changes are pushed.
